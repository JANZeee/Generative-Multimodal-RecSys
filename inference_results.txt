4. B089JLFWLS: ['Better Living Linea Rust Proof Durable Stainless Steel Shower Squeegee with Suction Hook for Convenient Storage .  . Elegant it is and heavy too, just a note to make sure the suction pad is tight before hanging the squeegee.  It hung best against the glass shower door, not so much on the wall.  Besides its sleek look it functions pretty awesomely with its long length to cover a wide area and the rubber worked well to pull the moisture off the surface.

5. B08BLBTYPH: ['ARZTIN A-Cera Barrier Toner, Hyaluronic Acid Deep Moisture Barrier Care Nourishing & Radiant Toner, 6.7 Fl. Oz .  . I have VERY sensitive skin and a lot of things irritate it so I’m always worried when I try something new. I spot test and wait, spot test and wait. This product doesn’t irritate my skin! First winning feature. It’s a milky toner which made me wonder but it’s moisturizing and balancing. It feels nice, allows me to skip additional moisturizing (normal combination skin) and leaves my skin clear and bright. Love this product and will buy more when this bottle is used up. Absolutely NO irritation.', "ChiroLux Curv | Cervical Neck Traction Device & Neck Posture Corrector.

It's adjustable so I have options and stores in a small space. It's a regular 'guest' in my suitcase when I travel and I don't leave home without it anymore.", "USUIE Red Light Therapy Belt, Infrared Light .  . I'm a true believer in the red light therapy camp. I've had excellent results myself and have seen the same on others. That being said, I have a bad neck and was hoping this would be flexible enough to use there and hopefully improve it. It does the job but is really hard to get it into place. It's easier on my shoulder or leg but I wish it was curved in shape for where I need it.

I’ve gone back to natural nails and needed files for them. I knew the 240 would be okay and was hoping the 180 would work. It does the job but I only use the 180 side for shortening my nails, it’s a bit rough and isn’t at all good for shaping.
